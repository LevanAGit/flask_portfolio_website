# Spiced Academy Final Project

For my final project at Spiced Academy, I built a website using Flask to display my Movie Recommender and Word Cloud Builder projects.

The Movie Recommender utilizes Non-Negative Matrix factorisation to recommend you a list of movies based on your own imputs and other IMDB users ratings.
The Word Cloud Builder takes in the users input of an artists name, runs a Fuzzy Lookup to correct  any mistakes in spelling and scrapes the web for lyrics sung by the artist. It then builds a word cloud showing the most used words so you see what your favorite artists are singing about.
